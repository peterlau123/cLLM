# cLLM build script
# It is a shell script that sets up the environment and builds the project using cmake.
# It is designed to be run from the command line.
# The script first checks if the build directory exists, and if not, creates it.
# It then changes to the build directory and runs cmake with the appropriate options.
# Finally, it runs the make command to build the project.
# The script also includes options for building with different configurations (debug, release, etc.)
